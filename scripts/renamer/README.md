# Renamer Script

This script renames all CSV files in a given directory to satisfy the naming requirement for files given to the postprocessor.

## Instructions

Call: `bash ./rename.sh directory" where *directory* is the name of the directory containing only CSV files.  The call will fail if there is anything that is not a CSV file in the directory.
